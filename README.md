To-do List

## Description

This application is a digital to-do list. The user is able to add a new task and make notes about that task. They are also able to check off tasks once they have been completed, and delete them from their list. 

The biggest challenge was figuring out a way to add a class to dynamic information, but after a little work that was fixed by changing the appending logic. If the task was complete, that row would instead be appended with the extra class.
